1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that allows users to store code like a time line. It stores files of code in chronological order. Allowing the user to see all the changes that have been made and letting the user go back to a previous version of code if the need should arise. While git is the actual software that allows for the storage of different iterations of code. Github is the interface that allows the user to access git in a user friendly fasion. Github allows code to be saved, shared, and even contributed to by multiple people in an easy to access manor.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An arrays index is the location of a type of data that's being stored within the array. The index allows you to access the data at that location. Javascript utilizes zero-indexing, meaning the first index in an array is index 0. An arrays value is what is being stored within the array. The value can consist of a primitive data type, such as numbers, booleans, strings. The difference between an array's index and its value is that the value is the data being stored inside the array and the index is the location of the data.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings are a type of data contained within quotation marks. A string could be anything from a letter, to numbers, a word, or symbol. An array is a place to store data. Arrays and strings are similar in the way that they can appear. Arrays can contain a string or multiple strings. Arrays can be converted into a string using the .join method. While strings can be split into arrays using the .split method strings and arrays can both be numbers or letters, however strings are only 1 data type where as arrays can contain multiple different types of data. A string may be "42" while an array may be [42]. These look the same but are very different. The array contains a number which is recognizeable by javascript and can be used to do math while the string "42" can only be called upon to be logged or returned as its written.

# UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that allows users to store code like a time line. It stores files of code in chronological order. Allowing the user to see all the changes that have been made and letting the user go back to a previous version of code if the need should arise. While git is the actual software that allows for the storage of different iterations of code. Github is the interface that allows the user to access git in a user friendly fasion. Github allows code to be saved, shared, and even contributed to by multiple people in an easy to access manor.

Researched answer: Git is a version control software(VCS). It stores changes to a file in layers. When a change is made and committed git stores a picture of the data of all the files in the directory. Git stores all of your change history locally so you can continue to work even if you don't have internet. While Git exists as a software github exists as a hosting service. Allowing you to store your code and changes online. Github also allows for others to access and make changes to code. Allowing companies to host access to code where other developers are able to access the data and make changes committing their contributions to the original data file.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An arrays index is the location of a type of data that's being stored within the array. The index allows you to access the data at that location. Javascript utilizes zero-indexing, meaning the first index in an array is index 0. An arrays value is what is being stored within the array. The value can consist of a primitive data type, such as numbers, booleans, strings. The difference between an array's index and its value is that the value is the data being stored inside the array and the index is the location of the data.

Researched answer: An arrays index is considered an ordinal data type called index type. Ordinal data types naturally contain an order. The element of an array consists of both the index and the value of the element. The indexs value is the location of the element within an array. The value of the element is the actual data type that makes up the element.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings are a type of data contained within quotation marks. A string could be anything from a letter, to numbers, a word, or symbol. An array is a place to store data. Arrays and strings are similar in the way that they can appear. Arrays can contain a string or multiple strings. Arrays can be converted into a string using the .join method. While strings can be split into arrays using the .split method strings and arrays can both be numbers or letters, however strings are only 1 data type where as arrays can contain multiple different types of data. A string may be "42" while an array may be [42]. These look the same but are very different. The array contains a number which is recognizeable by javascript and can be used to do math while the string "42" can only be called upon to be logged or returned as its written.

Researched answer: Strings and arrays are similar in the fact that they both act like an array for a type of data. A string is an array of characters, such as letters, numbers, or symbols. Often strings are used like text. While arrays can be any type of data. Strings and arrays both utilize index for a means to locate the value that exists within. Once a string is created its original value cannot be changed. While in an array you can change its values.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: The 4 pillars of object oriented programming are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Abstraction is like the logic of a function you can call a function without really knowing whats going on. Abstraction is like hiding the logic of a function behind a button that implements that logic.

Encapsulation is the act of wrapping up your code so it can only be accessed locally or by certain pieces of code. Encapsulation keeps your code from being global and helps things stay clean. for instance. The function used inside the parenthesis of .map is only acccessible within its self.

Inheritance is the relationship between code and its reusability. It follows the pattern of parent and child. The parent being the overarching code and the child being the slight changes you make. Inheritance should be done so that the parent and child are relevant and close to eachother. If the child starts changing the way the parent operates or you can't use the parent in place of the child you would youll likely end up with an error.

Polymorphism  is the ability to use the flow of inheritence. When done correctly you can utilize the parent anywhere you use the child without issue. Polymorphism focuses on the differences each step contains within an inheritance chain.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Objects: objects are a type of data containing a keyword and a value wrapped in curly braces, objects can be called using the .method using the keyword. You can iterate and destructure objects.

2. Classes: a classes is a little bit like a function and an array combined. Classes are reusable, they have very interesting syntax where the class name is capitalized and the object is always lower case. Classes are the structure that make up objects. Classes can not be called like a normal function. 

3. React: is a library that uses javascript. React is a front end user interface used to create user interfaces. Facebook created react. It was also used in the creation of instagram. It allows for easy managment of data and the state of the code. Its scalable and allows for the use of one language across multiple plaforms.
